Given:
1. An original question
2. A preliminary answer based on initial context (which may be incomplete)
3. The information gaps identified in that answer

Generate sub-questions that will help fill these gaps and provide a complete answer.

Guidelines:
- Focus on the INFORMATION GAPS identified in the preliminary answer
- Each sub-question should be SIMPLE and cover only ONE specific aspect
- Each sub-question should target a single missing piece of information
- Do NOT combine multiple aspects into one sub-question
- Sub-questions should be self-contained and answerable independently
- Keep sub-questions short and focused
- Maximum {max_sub_questions} sub-questions

DEFAULT_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """You are a research agent. Answer the question using the available tools.

Available tools:
- initial_search(): Search the knowledge base using the original question. Call this first, alone.
- search(query): Search the knowledge base with a custom query. Returns top results with docid and full document text.
- prune(docids): Keep only the specified documents (up to {prune_k}) and discard the rest from context. Use this when context is getting large to focus on the most relevant documents.
- find_information_gaps(): Identify what information is missing from the retrieved documents to answer the question.
- final_answer(answer): Submit your final answer. Call this alone when you are ready.

Workflow:
1. Call initial_search() alone as your first action.
2. Do additional search() calls targeting the identified gaps (you can batch multiple search calls together).
3. Use prune() if context grows too large.
4. When you have enough information, call final_answer(answer) with your complete answer.

Do one to four rounds of search after initial_search. Then call final_answer.
